# Prallel-Processing
Assignments as part of Academic Coursework -  (OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, MapReduce)

count_sort:
The aim of the program is to sort the integers in a fixed range using counting sort. The program takes input as the number of integers to be sorted. The user has to set the number of processors (p) in MPI and the integers are in normal distribution in the range -p to p.

hypercube_quick_sort:
The aim of the program is to sort large number of integers by simulating a hypercube in MPI and using parallel quicksort on hypercube. The user has to give input as the nuumber of integers to be sorted.
